# Hey, I'm Hemang! üë®‚Äçüíª

*Coffee-powered developer who turns ideas into Android apps*

## What I'm up to these days
Currently knee-deep in Android development, wrestling with Kotlin coroutines, and occasionally winning arguments with my IDE. When I'm not debugging why my LazyColumn won't scroll properly, you'll find me exploring the endless rabbit holes of DSA problems.

## My current obsessions
- **Android & Kotlin** - Building apps that (hopefully) don't crash on launch
- **Spring Boot with Kotlin** - Crafting backend APIs that actually work on the first try
- **Java** - The old reliable that taught me everything
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** - Because apparently knowing how to reverse a linked list will save the world
- **Open Source** - Recently dove into contributing and it's been an amazing learning experience

## Let's build something cool together
I'm always down for collaborating on projects that solve real problems or just sound fun to build. Whether it's a quirky Android app, an open source tool, or that "million-dollar idea" you've been sitting on - hit me up!

## Random dev facts about me
- I debug with `Log.d("Hello", "")` and I'm not ashamed
- My commit messages range from "fix bug" to "I have no idea what I did but it works now"
- I've watched more Android development tutorials than Netflix shows this year
- Currently exploring the wild world of open source contributions

**Fun fact:** This README was written during an Android Gradle build. Yes, I'm still waiting for it to finish.
